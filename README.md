# oDLT: fast optimal DLT-based PnP
Sebastien Henry and John A. Christian: Optimal DLT-based Solutions for the Perspective-n-Point (2024).

This repo contains fast MATLAB DLT implementations along with a new optimal weighted DLT. Our code is available in PnP/oDLT.

- Numerical synthetic experiments are provided in the script.
- We also added the real experiments. However, reproducing the real experiments (Vesta and ETH) require downloading the datasets and making sure the links are properly set.
