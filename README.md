# oDLT: fast optimal dlt-based PnP
Sebastien Henry and John A. Christian
Optimal DLT-based Solutions for the Perspective-n-Point (2024)

Our code is available in PnP/oDLT.

- We believe it should be relatively straightforward to reproduce the numerical experiment.
- We added the real experiments . However, reproducing the real experiments (Vesta and ETH) require downloading the datasets and making sure the links are properly set.
